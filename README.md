# Estimating Externality Reduction from Modal Shift to Rail Transport

## Project Overview

This project evaluates the potential reduction in transport externalities—such as noise, accidents, and congestion—by shifting deep-sea container transport from 100% road trucking to rail between Sohar and Muscat in Oman. The study aligns with the **Rail Growth Limited Carbon Footprint** initiative, aiming to assess public interest benefits through minimized negative externalities.

### Key Features:
- Quantification of externalities for road, diesel rail, and electric rail modes.
- Regional adjustments of EU-based unit costs for Omani conditions.
- Detailed breakdown of noise, accident, and congestion costs for each transport mode.
- A comparison of net costs between modes to justify the modal transition.

## Introduction

Negative externalities of transport, such as noise, accidents, and congestion, impose societal costs. This project quantifies these costs and evaluates the feasibility of transitioning container transport from road to rail.

- **Transport Modes Analyzed**:
  1. Road trucking (HGV).
  2. Diesel freight trains.
  3. Electric freight trains.

## Methodology

### Externalities Assessed:
1. **Accident Costs**:
   - Components: Human costs, medical costs, administrative costs, production loss.
   - Adjustments made for Oman’s population density, road safety, and insurance rates.

2. **Noise Costs**:
   - Components: Annoyance and health costs.
   - Factors: Population exposed to noise, healthcare development index, and regional purchasing power parity.

3. **Congestion Costs**:
   - Components: Delay costs and deadweight loss.
   - Considerations: Vehicle load, road capacity, and value of time.

### Assumptions:
- Daily container load: 100,000 tons.
- Trucks: 40 tons payload.
- Trains: 4,000 tons payload.
- Fully loaded operation, 320 workdays per year.
- Routes evaluated: Muscat Expressway and Batinah Expressway.

## Results

### Average External Costs (Per Ton-Kilometer):

| Transport Mode        | Accident (€-cent) | Noise (€-cent) | Congestion (€-cent) |
|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Road Trucking (HGV)** | 7.40             | 0.70           | 0.43                |
| **Diesel Train**       | 0.07             | 0.50           | 0.11                |
| **Electric Train**     | 0.07             | 0.75           | 0.11                |

### Net Cost Reduction (Per Workday):

| Mode Transition       | Accident Savings (£) | Noise Savings (£) | Congestion Savings (£) | Total Savings (£) |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Road → Diesel Train   | 1,977,456            | 55,066             | 2,103                   | 2,034,625         |
| Road → Electric Train | 1,977,456            | -11,816            | 2,103                   | 1,967,743         |

## Discussion

- **Key Insights**:
  - Diesel trains show the highest cost savings due to lower noise and accident costs.
  - Electric trains have higher noise costs, attributed to EU-based assumptions requiring further regional research.

- **Limitations**:
  - Externality estimates rely on regional adjustments of EU-based data, which introduces potential inaccuracies.
  - The study does not include electricity generation costs for electric trains, which may impact their feasibility.

## Conclusion

This study demonstrates that transitioning from road to rail transport can significantly reduce societal costs in Oman. Diesel trains are the most cost-effective solution, followed by electric trains. However, further studies incorporating detailed regional data and energy costs are recommended to refine these findings.
